## 📊 Retail Business Performance & Profitability Analysis

### 📝 Description

This project aims to analyze retail transaction data to identify:

- Low-performing product categories
- Profitability margins by sub-category
- Inventory inefficiencies

### 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- **SQL**: Data cleaning, aggregation, profit margin calculation  
- **Python** (Pandas, Seaborn): Correlation analysis  
- **Tableau**: Dashboard for interactive visualization

### 📌 Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**: Removed NULLs and duplicates using SQL.
2. **Profit Margin Calculation**: SQL queries grouped by category/sub-category.
3. **Correlation Analysis**: Assessed relationship between inventory days and profit.
4. **Visualization**: Built a Tableau dashboard to explore trends and performance.

### 📈 Outcome

- Identified unprofitable and overstocked inventory.
- Suggested discontinuation of low-margin items.
- Recommended seasonal promotions for high-demand categories.
